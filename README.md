The goal of this project is to write documentation and share necessary code to allow former ETH miners to repurpose their hardware for GPU-accelerated deep learning services offered through openlab. Openlab is a protocol enabling token-gated APIs for biomedicine. Few people have the hardware to fold proteins and dock small molecules at scale. Their number one constraint is (NVIDIA) GPU power. By offering containerized applications on their infrastructure via the openlab protocol, former ETH miners can 1) help accelerate progress in biomedicine, 2) earn stablecoins for their compute services, and 3) get $LAB governance token rewards giving them shared control of the community building openlab.

## Problem 
ETH is (perhaps) moving to proof of stake in the summer. A lot of Ethereum community members are sitting on stale GPU ressources. 

## Solution
Instead of continuing the mining by switching to another protocol, we want to offer an alternative way to put the valuable hardware to use: folding proteins, docking small molecules etc. 

## Technology
Your GPU miner with the following hardware: 
* NVIDIA graphics card
  * RTX3090
  * RTX3080Ti
  * RTX3080
  * RTX3070
  * RTX3060
* SSD storage

Please make sure you have Ubuntu installed.

## Team 
to be determined - ETHminers that want to take the green pill and help repurpose their infrastructure for biomedicine wanted. 

## Financials 
to be determined - bragging rights guaranteed, LabDAO governance rights likely.
